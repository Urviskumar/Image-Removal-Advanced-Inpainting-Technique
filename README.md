The objective of this project is to remove squirrels from a set of images through inpainting. Given a list of five image filenames and corresponding masks for squirrels in each image, the project utilizes StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline to inpaint the images, effectively eliminating the presence of squirrels.

IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
In the fascinating realm of computer vision, the project "Removing Squirrels" delves into the intricate process of erasing squirrels from images using advanced inpainting techniques. This undertaking is not just about visually altering pictures but involves a sophisticated interplay of algorithms and visual processing that transforms ordinary images into seamless, squirrel-free compositions.

Inpainting Unveiled:
At the core of this project lies the concept of inpainting, a technique that goes beyond mere image manipulation. Inpainting involves the reconstruction of missing or damaged portions of an image, leveraging surrounding information to seamlessly fill in the gaps. For our purpose, the challenge is to artf0ully remove squirrels from images.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Inpainting Pipeline Initialization:
The project initializes the inpainting pipeline using StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline. The pipeline is configured with the pre-trained model from "runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting." The initialized pipeline is set to operate on CPU for inpainting tasks.
